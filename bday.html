                            The day after your birthday,
                            <br>
                            you look in the mirror to see:
                            <br>
                            a) you've got a zit from eating all that cake;<br>
                            b) your love handles have expanded a half inch;<br>
                            c) you singed your eyebrows blowing out the candles.<br>
                            <br>
                            The day after your birthday,<br>
                            a) you require six extra hours of sleep;<br>
                            b) you can't find your living room under the birthday debris;<br>
                            c) you wonder how you could possibly have done THAT.<br>
                            <br>
                            The day after your birthday, it's time to:<br>
                            a) return some gifts (what IS that, anyway?);<br>
                            b) call your friends and apologize for yesterday;<br>
                            c) get out of the country, fast.<br>
                            <br>
                            The day after your birthday...<br>
                            we should all look so great<br>
                            and have it so good!<br>
                            <br>
